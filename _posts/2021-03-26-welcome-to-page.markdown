Hi everyone, 

my name is Filip and I'm curious robotics engineer currently pursuing my PhD degree in robotics on 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb. My interests
are mostly intertwining of robotic manipulation, aerial robotics and artificial intelligence. 
In my previous technical work, one of the main obstacles was finding right material in the right time. 
Information age has obviously ushered way to information overload, whereas purpose of this page is 
my small contribution to battleing it. In last few years (3 give or take month) I've worked 
on several robotics projects whose complexity required using right tools. In next few 
posts I'll provide information about those tools that could be of help to you to.  

Main goal of the page is sharing right information with curious students, and future 
robotics engineers/scientist, and getting them started working on interesting stuff 
right away. 

Thank you for your time, and have a nice day :)
