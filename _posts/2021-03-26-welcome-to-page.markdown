Hi everyone,
my name is Filip and I’m a curious robotics engineer currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in robotics at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.
My interests are mostly intertwining robotic manipulation, aerial robotics, and artificial intelligence. 

In my previous technical work, one of the main obstacles was finding the right material at the right time. 
The information age has ushered way to information overload, whereas the purpose of this page is my small contribution to battling it. 

In the last few years (3 give or take a month) I’ve worked on several robotics projects whose complexity required using the right tools. 
In the next few posts, I’ll provide information about those tools that could be of help to you too.
The main goal of the page is sharing the right information with curious students, and future robotics engineers/scientists, and getting them started working on interesting stuff right away.

Thank you for your time, and have a nice day :)
