# Here are some cool stuff that could be helpful 

### Network protocols 

Protocols are all around you, I've been trying to grasp why we use them since 
I've started programming. I'm still not 100% sure why do we need them, and so 
much of them, but I guess we do. 

[Brief introductory article for most important network protocols](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/technology/networking/12-most-important-protocols-to-learn-for-networking) 

You can run and you can hide... But...you'll eventually use some protocol.
It's somewhat proffesional to know why you should use it. 

Most important protocols are (e.g. I've worked most with them) : 
 * TCP
 * UDP 
 * HTTP 
 * RTSP/RTP 

### Concurrency

So, sometimes you have to write code that does two things at once. And that can be really painful. 
Especially if you're C++ noob as me and don't have an idea how to do that. Well this book is 
quite helpful as it contains just right amount of theory as well as practical examples to do
it just fine by yourself.

### ROS stuff

Pretty cool cheat-sheet for ROS:

The Robotics Knowledgebase exists to advance knowledge in the robotics discipline:

#### NCNN-ROS

Cool repostiory that contains multiple ROS implementations of nerual networks (mostly vision).

#### Ros Spinning, Threading, Queueing 

One of the main facilities that ROS provides is the publisher-subscriber communicationÂ² that is used for message-passing between components. While it is easy to implement the publisher-subscriber, it is not obvious what is going on underneath it and how we can tailor it to our specific problems in practice. 
In this post, there's talk about the mechanisms behind the publisher-subscriber in ROS such as its execution model, threading, queuing mechanism.

#### ROS control 

ROS Control combines a set of packages that include controller interfaces, controller managers, transmissions and hardware_interfaces.  
The ROS control framework is used to implement and manage robot controllers for real robots and in simulation within gazebo.

#### Computer Vision 

Awesome lectures by Joseph Redmon (creator of YOLO neural network).
